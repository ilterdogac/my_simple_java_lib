	// FIXME: Add support for modules!!!
	/*  Here are something about Java modules with my words, from what I've learned.
	 *  Modules add additional encapsulation in the code and make it easy for the
	 *  code to be written as separate pieces that are less dependent on each other
	 *  (decreasing coupling) and as cumulated small pieces each containing classes
	 *  that are dependent on many of them (increasing cohesion). Modules can define
	 *  additional restrictions on top of the access modifiers by keeping their ‚Äúpublic‚Äù
	 *  classes from other modules.
	 *  
	 *  A classloader can have many modules but a module can have only one classloader.
	 *  And multiple modules have same or different named classes being in same
	 *  packages (and therefore completely unaware of each other just like 2 possibly same
	 *  classes in different classloaders which none of them is parent of other), but apparently
	 *  this is OK only in the compile-time, as the JVM in the runtime throws
	 *  LayerInstantiationException and says that the same package (even if they do not have
	 *  any same class) is in 2 modules.
	 *  
	 *  In stacktraces, compile-time and runtime errors, packages belonging to named
	 *  modules can be seen as moduleName/fullClassName such as the following:
	 *       - ‚Äújava.base/java.lang.Object‚Äù
	 *       - ‚Äújava.base/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe‚Äù
	 *  latter of which you can't access (despite being public) just because of the
	 *  module encapsulations; that is that the module ‚Äújava.base‚Äù does not
	 *  'exports' the package ‚Äújdk.internal.misc‚Äù to any of your modules --- so you
	 *  can't get Unsafe, because it is unsafe to get Unsafe xD just as public static
	 *  sun.misc.Unsafe sun.misc.unsafe.getUnsafe() says!
	 *  
	 *  Although Eclipse (don't know about IntelliJ Idea) defines every module as a
	 *  projects that you can add other modules as dependencies (just like you do to use
	 *  JavaFX) and you can't define multiple modules within a single projects, you can
	 *  compile all of them with javac at once by placing all sources of every module
	 *  into one of the sibling (having same direct parents) folders that has the same
	 *  name of the module, putting the relevant module-info.java right under the folder
	 *  of every module and giving all source files' (including module-infos') paths and
	 *  specifying the path of the parent file containing all the module folders as
	 *  ‚Äú--module-source-path‚Äù. In Eclipse, I think the multiple modules can be handled
	 *  to be in a single project by linking all the source folders and omitting (except)
	 *  the module-info files into project hence breaking and ignoring the module
	 *  encapsulation to get the IDE accept the code, whereas the folder of the modules
	 *  can be compiled with javac occasionally to often to make sure the code written in
	 *  Eclipse did not actually break the module encapsulation.

		/* In the delegation model, if a classloader hasn't loaded a class (if has it just returns it from
		 * findLoadedClass(String)) it just doesn't greedily try to find its bytecode from somewhere, but
		 * first delegates the request to its parent and expects the java.lang.Class object from it and
		 * recursively the delegate reaches to the (primorder) Bootstrap ClassLoader (until any of the
		 * classLoaders on the way has already found and defined it from its bytecode therefore just returns
		 * it), then it tries to find it; if it can't, its child tries to find and finally the first
		 * ClassLoader (farthest from the BootStrap on the delegation chain) tries to find by its custom way
		 * (maybe download from the network, generate from somewhere or just load from a file just like the
		 * java.net.URLClassLoader ‚ÄúSystem ClassLoader‚Äù).
		 * 
		 * Here however, if this hasn't loaded the class, this tries to find and define it first, so it can load a
		 * class that has the same name with another one in its direct or one of indirect parents and can SHADOW THAT CLASS.
		 * In the normal delegation, that occurs only if one of the (in)direct children of [a classloader that CAN
		 * find it] has already found and defined it; it just returns it from findLoadedClass(String) even before
		 * forwarding the delegate to its parent.
		 * 
		 * Now you know that instances of classloader load a ‚ÄúMain‚Äù class by trying to redefine it even if their
		 * parents has already looaded one with the same binary name.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * But, what happens if I instantiate one (B), over a parent (let's say A) that can and has loaded class
		 * ‚ÄúMain‚Äù with a very useful method/field for one of my general-purpose classes like ‚Äúfn‚Äù (functions) and
		 * let B load an altered ‚ÄúMain‚Äù that is for some kind of a sub-application and not even aware of what my
		 * usual ‚ÄúMain‚Äù looks like? When a method of a class on B call a method of ‚Äúfn‚Äù and it calls that useful method
		 * on ‚ÄúMain‚Äù, will B directly try to get its own ‚ÄúMain‚Äù for ‚ÄúA‚Äù's ‚Äúfn‚Äù while fn normally would expect such ‚ÄúMain‚Äù
		 * like the one loaded on A? Or load right what ‚Äúfn‚Äù's method expects? It will act resembling C++'s logic of
		 * calling the version of overridden virtual method that DEPENDS on constructor/destructor of which the
		 * hell class' of the object the virtual method is invoked is currently the last frame of the callstack of
		 * the thread that invoked the method; that is, call to the virtual method ‚ÄúgetArea‚Äù by the destructor of
		 * Shape class (or by any method being called by that destructor) while destructing a Rectangle object
		 * results in calling its Shape version, not the version of the class the object is an instance of
		 * (Rectangle). In that way; when you suppose that java.lang.String (from the bootstrap ClassLoader)
		 * referred to a class named ‚Äúfoo.bar.A‚Äù, defining the same class (named as ‚Äúfoo.bar.A‚Äù) on your classloader
		 * definitely would not cause your using of java.lang.String from that classloader to refer to (and use) your
		 * version of ‚Äúfoo.bar.A‚Äù instead of what it normally expects. However, what if it was so just because the
		 * things have come up that way while designing the Java runtime and has not had that emphasis on making it
		 * that way it has been made? Why not try to actually ensure this by, maybe trying to map a Classloader to
		 * the current thread when entering and removing it while exitting some method or something like that?
